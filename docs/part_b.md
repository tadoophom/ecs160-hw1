# Part B – Computing Repository Statistics

This note describes the Part B requirements and how the current Rust code implements them after the raw GitHub data has been fetched.

## Problem recap
- From the top 10 repositories gathered per language, compute:
  1. Total stars and forks.
  2. The files touched in the latest 50 commits, then determine the top 3 most-modified files per repo.
  3. The number of new commits in the 20 most recent forks (ignoring nested forks).
  4. The total count of open issues across the 10 repositories.
- Display the results in a readable format.

## Implementation tour

### Statistics aggregation (`collect_language_report`)
- After fetching commits, issues, and forks, `collect_language_report` calls `summarize_repos(&repos)`.
- It also computes simple totals directly:
  - `total_stars`: sum of `repo.stargazers_count`.
  - `total_forks`: sum of `repo.forks_count`.
  - `total_open_issues`: sum of `repo.issues.len()` (actual open issues retrieved).
  - `total_repo_commits`: sum of `repo.commit_count` (recent commits for the base repo).

### File-level metrics (`compute_top_files`)
- Accepts a single `Repo`.
- Walks through `repo.recent_commits`, which now contain file diff data because Part A fetched commit details with `files`.
- Uses a `HashMap<String, i64>` to accumulate a “change score” per filename (`changes`, or additions+deletions when `changes` is zero).
- Sorts by descending score (and then alphabetically) and returns the top 3 filenames.

### New fork commits (`count_new_commits`)
- Operates on each fork’s `Repo` data.
- Uses the fork’s `created_at` timestamp to filter fork commits whose author date is after the fork was created.
- `summarize_repos` totals these counts across up to 20 forks per base repo (controlled by `MAX_FORKS_TO_PROCESS`).

### Reporting (`print_summary`)
- Formats the aggregated data for console output:
  - Language name, total stars, total forks.
  - Top 3 modified files (or a fallback message if none).
  - New commits found in the inspected forks.
  - Total open issues discovered.

## Rust concepts worth noting
- **Iterators**: Extensive iterator chains (`map`, `sum`, `filter`, `collect`) make the aggregation concise.
- **HashMap usage**: `and_modify` / `or_insert` keep change-accumulation logic simple.
- **Option handling**: `count_new_commits` uses `Option::map` and `and_then` to protect against missing timestamps.
- **Ownership and borrowing**: Immutable borrows of `repos` allow the same data to be reused when printing and cloning later.

## Gaps & cautions (relevant for Part B)
- **Open issue counts**: The GitHub API call fetches only the first 100 issues per repo. If a repository has more than 100 open issues, the current code undercounts the total. Pagination would be needed for exact numbers.
- **Fork commit timestamps**: The comparison is string-based (`commit_date > fork_created_at`). ISO-8601 timestamps compare correctly lexicographically, but converting them to `DateTime` objects would be more robust.
- **Performance**: Fetching per-commit file data means up to 50 additional HTTP requests per repo. This is faithful to the spec but may hit rate limits without caching or delay handling.

Overall, Part B’s statistics pipeline is implemented and produces the requested metrics, though pagination and rate-limit resilience are areas to consider if precision is critical.
